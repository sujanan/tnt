Tnt is a small, toy BitTorrent client written in C, using only the standard library. Tnt aims to provide a basic understanding of the protocol for those who want to learn it or implement it themselves.
Tnt runs on a small, built-in event loop on a single thread. Inspired by this awesome blog [post](https://blog.jse.li/posts/torrent/).
